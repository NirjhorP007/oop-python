# 🧭 Python OOP - 10-Week Course Outline

**Duration:** 10 weeks × 3–4 hours/week  
**Prerequisites:**  
- Basic Python (variables, loops, functions, conditionals)  
- No prior OOP experience needed  
- Development environment: VS Code, Git + Github

**Course Goals:**  
By the end of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand and apply the main principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python  
- Design and implement small- to medium-scale applications using OOP concepts  
- Write clean, maintainable, and testable code  
- Use simple design patterns and best practices for structuring Python projects
